# Bot Factory

This web app is used for creating/managing the key-value pairings for a json. 

For this specific case, we are using it in generating keyword - responses for auto-generating a bot (NPC) to be used in VR simulations.

### How to use

You can choose to upload an existing configuration file(s).

These files must be uploaded one at a time.

Note: you must upload files that end in .json.



When adding your own keyword-responses please note the following:

1. Cannot repeat the same keyword, but can repeat the same response.

2. For the same response, you can add multiple different keywords separated by a comma (,)
