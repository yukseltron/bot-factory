# Virtual Assistance BotðŸ¤–


[See the site](https://bot-factory.netlify.app/)




### Background
This is my portion for our Capstone project. [Here's a video of the project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yhq2RHWto)


### What this is
This web app is used for creating/managing the key-value pairings for a json. [Checkout the project page here](https://www.yooksel.com/#/virtual-assistance-bot)

For this specific case, we are using it in generating keyword - responses for auto-generating a bot (NPC) to be used in VR simulations.

[See this repo for more on the bot](https://github.com/AnthonyMella66/Capstone2019)

### How to use

You can choose to upload an existing configuration file(s).

These files must be uploaded one at a time.

#### Note: you must upload files that end in .json.



When adding your own keyword-responses please note the following:

1. Cannot repeat the same keyword, but can repeat the same response.

2. For the same response, you can add multiple different keywords separated by a comma (,)




#### Made with [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
